Every Supabase project has its own dedicated Postgres instance running in a virtual machine (VM).

Paid plan projects can upgrade to Micro instances at no additional charge.

## Compute Sizes

| Size   | CPU                     | Memory | Max DB Connections | Monthly Price (USD) |
|--------|-------------------------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Nano   | Shared                  | 0.5 GB | 60                 | $0                 |

| 12XL   | 48-core ARM (dedicated) | 192 GB | 500                | ~$2,800            |
| 16XL   | 64-core ARM (dedicated) | 256 GB | 500                | ~$3,730            |

Compute sizes can be changed in the dashboard, but upgrades will incur downtime.

## Dedicated vs. Shared CPU

Larger compute instances (Large and above) guarantee a dedicated physical CPU.

## Disk IO

SSD disk performance depends on compute size and disk attributes.

| Compute Size | Max Disk Throughput | Baseline Disk Throughput | Baseline IOPS | Burst IOPS |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------|
| Nano (free)  | 2,085 Mbps          | 43 Mbps                  | 250 IOPS      | 11,800 IOPS|
| Micro        | 2,085 Mbps          | 87 Mbps                  | 500 IOPS      | 11,800 IOPS|
| Small        | 2,085 Mbps          | 174 Mbps                 | 1,000 IOPS    | 11,800 IOPS|
| Medium       | 2,085 Mbps          | 347 Mbps                 | 2,000 IOPS    | 11,800 IOPS|
| Large        | 4,750 Mbps          | 630 Mbps                 | 3,600 IOPS    | 20,000 IOPS|
| XL           | 4,750 Mbps          | 1,188 Mbps               | 6,000 IOPS    | 20,000 IOPS|
| 2XL          | 4,750 Mbps          | 2,375 Mbps               | 12,000 IOPS   | 20,000 IOPS|
| 4XL          | 4,750 Mbps          | 4,750 Mbps               | 20,000 IOPS   | N/A        |
| 8XL          | 9,500 Mbps          | 9,500 Mbps               | 40,000 IOPS   | N/A        |
| 12XL         | 14,250 Mbps         | 14,250 Mbps              | 50,000 IOPS   | N/A        |
| 16XL         | 19,000 Mbps         | 19,000 Mbps              | 80,000 IOPS   | N/A        |

### Storage Volume Types

- **gp3 (Default)**: Up to 16TB, 3,000-16,000 IOPS, 125-1,000 MB/s throughput
- **io2**: Up to 60TB, up to 256,000 IOPS (capped at 80,000 IOPS by CPU)

Choose based on your performance needs.

### Constraints

- 6-hour cooldown after disk attribute changes
- Can increase volume size but not decrease
- Performance affected by add-on size

## Postgres Replication

Replication slots and WAL senders vary by compute size, ranging from 5 for smaller instances to 80 for larger ones.

## Upgrade Downtime

Compute changes usually take less than 2 minutes but may vary depending on the Cloud Provider.
